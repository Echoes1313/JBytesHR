JBytesHR
========

JBytesHR is a Javascript library that converts byte values to human-readable strings (e.g. 6000000000 -> "5.59 GB")

JBytesHR is currently looking for OO Javascript developers to contribute to the effort to create the best byte-conversion library in the land. Also looking to create an awesome test suite and examples.
